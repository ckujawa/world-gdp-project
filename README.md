# world-gdp-project
A project I'm working on that uses Spring, MySql (with the world database), and React to allow a user to explore GDP information from the World Bank GDP Api.
Based on the World GDP project in the book [Spring 5.0 Projects](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-5-0-Projects-development-projects-ebook/dp/B07M67XWK2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=FK1V3QKU05GX&dchild=1&keywords=spring+5.0+projects&qid=1614633189&sprefix=Spring+5.0%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-1)
